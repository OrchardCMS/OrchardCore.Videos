# Amazon S3 Media Storage: Keep Media in an S3 Bucket

**YouTube:** not published yet · **Length:** 5:43 · **Feature:** `OrchardCore.Media.AmazonS3` ([documentation](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/reference/modules/Media.AmazonS3/))

A video for developers and hosting engineers on the Amazon S3 Media module. It shows why media can live in an Amazon S3
bucket, how to configure the connection and run against an S3 emulator, how to enable Amazon Media Storage and follow an
uploaded file to the browser, what the feature registers, how Amazon Media Image Cache keeps resized images in a bucket,
and how buckets, folders, and tenant removal are configured. The title, description, tags and chapters YouTube shows are
in `video.json`.

## Recording it again

The video is recorded on a **fresh site** with fake data only, so it needs no mask script. The full plan, with the exact
actions of every step, is in `recording-plan.md`; what a person must confirm on a running site is in
`OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`.

1. Start the S3Mock emulator in Docker (the command is in `recording-plan.md`). It accepts any keys, so the video uses
   the placeholder `dummy`.
2. Build `src/OrchardCore.Cms.Web` of OrchardCore and run it with `ORCHARD_APP_DATA` pointing at an empty folder outside
   both repositories, on `http://localhost:5010`, provisioned by Auto Setup (the Blog recipe, site name **Orchard Core**,
   time zone `America/Los_Angeles`, user `admin`, email `admin@example.com`). Set the `OrchardCore__Media__AmazonS3__...`
   environment variables of the plan, which point both features at the emulator. Neither feature is enabled before
   recording.
3. Copy `home-bg.jpg` from the Blog theme of OrchardCore into a folder outside git. It is the only file uploaded.
4. Sign the recorder in (the password comes from `VIDEO_PASSWORD`, chosen outside git), then stop the site and copy
   `App_Data` aside as snapshot `S0`. The plan names the snapshots `S1` and `S2`; restore the one before a clip, start a
   fresh emulator container, and delete the `ms-cache` and `media-cache` folders of the web root, before each take.
5. Narrate and record: `scripts/narrate.py videos/media-amazon-s3`, then `Recorder record 03-enable 03-check 04-serve
   06-cache`, in that order. `03-check` only reads; `03-enable`, `04-serve` and `06-cache` change the site, and `04-serve`
   and `06-cache` depend on the clips before them.
